# Uranium-Anomalies
## Predicting Uranium Anomalies in the Northern Territory
### Conducted work in collaboration with a mining exploration company to identify new ways of discovering uranium deposits using existing available data.
This case study was focused on using the geochemical sample dataset from STRIKE (https://strike.nt.gov.au/wss.html) in an attempt to identify potential mineral deposits for the radioactive elements targetting the mineral exploration of Uranium across the NT. The model predicts uranium anomalies with some success using either a random forest regression model or XGBoost model. There are positives and negatives to using both models, however, despite appearing to overfit the data slightly, both show the potential for reliable prediction of the rare events from the trained models, especially with more tuning and pruning of predictors in the future.
