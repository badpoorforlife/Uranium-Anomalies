# Uranium-Anomalies
## Predicting Uranium Anomalies in the Northern Territory
### Conducted work in collaboration with a mining exploration company to identify new ways of discovering uranium deposits using existing available data.
This case study was focused on using the geochemical sample dataset from STRIKE (https://strike.nt.gov.au/wss.html) in an attempt to identify potential mineral deposits for the radioactive elements targetting the mineral exploration of Uranium across the NT. The model successfully predicts uranium anomalies with either a random forest regression model or XGBoost model. There are positives and negatives to using both models, but both show reliable prediction of the rare events from the trained models.
